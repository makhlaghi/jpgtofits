JPGtoFITS
=========

Convert a JPEG image to a FITS file (colors as FITS extensions).



Description:
------------

The [FITS image
standard](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/fits.html) is the
standard used by astronomers to archive and use astronomical
data. This package converts images saved in the JPEG format into
FITS. 

In case the JPEG image is not greyscale (with only one color channel),
several color channels will be involved. JPGtoFITS will save the
channels (in the same order that they are saved in the JPEG file) as
successive extensions to the output FITS image.



Requirements:
------------

JPGtoFITS requires two packages to be installed on your
machine, installing them is easy and straightforward. 

- [IJG's libjpeg](http://www.ijg.org/), which should already be
  installed  on your system.
- [cfitsio](http://heasarc.nasa.gov/fitsio/fitsio.html) For
  reading and writing FITS files. I have explained [how to install
  `cfitsio` here](http://www.astr.tohoku.ac.jp/~akhlaghi/cfitsiowcslibinstall.html)



Installing and running:
-----------------------
 
To install JPGtoFITS, after downloading or cloning it, all you have
to do is to run the standard configuring, compiling and installing
commands in the downloaded directory (`$` as user and `#` as root):

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make check
    # make install

See `./INSTALL` for a standard review of the GNU build and install
methods.



Manual and documentation:
-------------------------

An extensive manual (built in Texinfo and available in various
formats) is also available. The simplest way to access it is by
running the command `info jpgtofits` on the command line after you
install JPGtoFITS.

You can make the manual in pdf, dvi, html or plain text formats by
running `make pdf`, `make html`, `make dvi` and so on. You just have
to have Texinfo and TeX installed on your system.



Future updates and issues:
--------------------------

1. Add much more functionality and generality.
2. Work on a better user experience.
3. Fix any bugs I have not found yet!



Comments and suggestions:
-------------------------

I hope JPGtoFITS will be useful for you. If you find any problems in
this program please contact me so I can correct them. I would also be
very glad to hear any suggestions or comments you might have, thank
you.
